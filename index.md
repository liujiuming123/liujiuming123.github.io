## Jiuming Liu (刘久铭)

I am a second-year master student at the [IRMV Lab](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/) in the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Hesheng Wang](https://irmv.sjtu.edu.cn/wanghesheng) and to collaborate with many wonderful co-authors: [Dr.Guangming Wang](https://guangmingw.github.io/), [Dr.Lihao Liu](https://lihaoliu-cambridge.github.io/), and [Dr.Angelica I. Aviles-Rivero](https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/) from [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/); [Chaokang Jiang](https://jiangchaokang.github.io/) from PhiGent Robotics, etc. My research interests include a wide range of computer vision fields, especially how to perceive, comprehend, localize, render, and generate realistic 2D/3D/4D worlds. From June to August in 2023, I also served as a research assistant in [Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html), advised by Prof. [Yunhui Liu](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/). From Aug. to Sep. 2024, I visited the DAMTP, Univeristy of Cambridge, kindly advised by Prof. [Angelica](https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/). During my master period, I have published **8 international conference papers** in artificial intelligence and computer vision domains, including AAAI 2023, ICCV 2023, CVPR 2024, ECCV 2024, and NeurIPS 2024. I also actively served as the reviewer of top conferences like CVPR 2024, ECCV 2024, and NeurIPS 2024, and journals like IJCV, IEEE TCSVT, IEEE TASE, etc. 

**Recently, I am looking for a PhD position, welcome to contact me at email: liujiuming@sjtu.edu.cn**.
